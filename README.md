# Usage

This API requires jwt authorization. To be able to call methods in this API one must first call `GET  /BasketAuthorization/connect/token` in order to get a authorization token. Then send it in the request headers:

```cs
var uri = "http://localhost:49435";
var httpConnection = new HttpConnection(uri);
var client = new BasketsAuthorizationClient(httpConn);
var token = await client.GetTokenAsync();
```

and then with this token create an http connection for the client using the token:

```cs
var header = new Tuple<string, string>("Authorization", token);
var httpConn = new HttpConnection(uri, headers);
var client = new BasketsClient(httpConn);
```
